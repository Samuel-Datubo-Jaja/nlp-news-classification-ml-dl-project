I implemented and compared multiple text classification models for categorizing news articles into World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech categories. Developed a comprehensive solution using traditional machine learning approaches (Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM). 

## Key Accomplishments:

1. Performed thorough exploratory data analysis on the AG News dataset (120,000 articles)
2. Developed preprocessing pipelines for text standardization and vectorization
3. Implemented and fine-tuned four models with detailed hyperparameter optimization
4. Achieved 93.11% accuracy with the best-performing model (Bi-LSTM)
5. Created detailed visualizations for model performance analysis
6. Conducted in-depth error analysis identifying cross-category misclassifications.

## Technologies: 
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, NLTK, pandas, matplotlib
